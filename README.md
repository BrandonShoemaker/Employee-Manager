## Description

In this program you follow a series of prompts given by the command line to enter however many employees you would like to add. These commands will include the name, employee Id, email, and other position specefic information. Afterwards it will process all information into an HTML file, creating one if necessary. This program also contains a handful of tests for you to use if you want to.

## Usage 

First you will need to follow the steps to install all necessary tools and technologies. After you have done so, assuming you are already inside this projects root directory, you will run the command node index.js in the command line.
